## React Hooks Workshop

Go ahead and clone this repo, and then run:

```
yarn install

// or

npm install
```

To run the rest of the content, you'll do:

```
yarn run dev

// or

npm run dev

```

...and then you'll open up your localhost:3000 (or other port if your computer changes it).

We'll be live-coding the entire time, so get your fingers ready!
